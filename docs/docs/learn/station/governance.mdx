# Governance

If this is your first time using Station, follow the [Station tutorial](download/station-desktop.mdx).

Governance is an important part of being involved in the Terra community. This tutorial walks you through how to vote on and submit governance proposals on Station. For more information on governance and voting options, check out [the governance overview](../protocol.mdx#governance).

## Vote on a proposal

Voting is an important process in which community members are able to have their say in the evolution of the Terra protocol. Follow the steps below to cast a vote with your staked assets.

1. Open Station and connect your wallet. In the sidebar, click **Governance**.

2. Click on **Voting** to view the active proposals.

3. Click on the proposal you would like to vote on.

4. In the upper right-hand corner, click **Vote**.

6. Click **Submit**.

Your vote will be cast for the proposal.

## Proposal deposits

Users can vote on a proposal after a minimum token deposit is reached. The minimum deposit for Terra is 512. Other chains may have different minimum amounts. To help push a proposal forward to a vote, you may deposit tokens into the proposal.

To prevent spam, all governance proposals must obtain a minimum deposit. On the Terra chain, if 33.4% of the total vote is `NoWithVeto`, `quorum` is not met, or the minimum deposit isn't reached, the deposit will be burned. All other vote outcomes get their deposits refunded. For more information on deposits and refunds, visit the [Terra governance overview](../protocol.mdx#governance).

<Admonition type="tip" icon="💡" title="Community feedback">

Before submitting a proposal on the Terra chain, try to get community feedback on [the Terra Agora research forum](https://agora.terra.money) or the respective forum on the proposal you're creating.
Do not use text proposals to suggest parameter changes. For more information, visit the [Terra Governance module reference page](../../develop/module-specifications/spec-governance.mdx).

3. Select the type of proposal, enter a title, a description, and the number of tokens you will offer as an initial deposit.

4. Enter your password and click **Submit**.

Your proposal will enter the deposit period. After the minimum deposit has been reached, the proposal will enter a voting period. Governance parameters will vary between chains. On the Terra chain, the minimum deposit is 512 Luna, the deposit period can last up to two weeks, and the voting period lasts one week.
