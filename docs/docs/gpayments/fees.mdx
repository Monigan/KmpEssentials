# Fees Structure

We have recently launched a payment gateway that allows any dApp on any ecosystem to handle on chain payments for the Terra Ecosystem.

We provide one-time payments & Subscriptions, which are easy to configure on your app, via the payment SDK.

Our fee Structure (for each Payment transaction) for the Payment gateway is like so:

| Fee Structure | Who Receives it?                                                                                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0.2%          | [Burn Wallet Address](https://finder.terra.money/classic/address/terra1sk06e3dyexuq4shw77y3dsv480xv42mq73anxu) |
| 99.6%         | Your Business Wallet: What you receive by using the Payment Gateway                                            |
| 0.2%          | Transaction Fees (What we take from each transaction as payment)                                               |
